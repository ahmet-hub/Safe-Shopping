# Safe-Shopping
I am currently working on this project

This project has emerged in line with the security problems experienced by people while buying / selling second-hand products on the internet.
It prevents the seller from delivering the product without price.
It prevents the buyer from paying before receiving the product.

How is it working ?

In the system , after the two parties (seller,buyer) agree with each other, the buyer sends the price to the person who bought the product over the application,
and the money remains securely in the application until he approves. After the seller succesfuly delivers the product to the other party, if the buyer approves the purchase 
the price of the product is delivered to the seller.
